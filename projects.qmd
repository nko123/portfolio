### The Menendez Brothers: From Courtrooms to Comments Sections
**Georgetown University - DSAN 5000**

#### Project Subtitle
The Transformation of Menendez Media Narratives

#### Overview
On August 20, 1989, Lyle and Erik Menendez shot and killed their parents in their Beverly Hills mansion. What followed was one of the most sensationalized criminal trials in American history. But the story didn't end with their 1996 conviction—it evolved dramatically over 35 years, from tabloid sensation to Netflix phenomenon, from "cold-blooded killers" to potential victims of abuse deserving of freedom.

This data science project traces how public discourse around the Menendez brothers transformed across three decades and multiple media platforms, revealing fundamental shifts in how American society understands family violence, male victimization, and criminal justice.

#### Key Features

- Analysis of media narratives spanning 35 years (1989-2024)
- Multi-platform discourse analysis: traditional media, social media, and streaming content
- Natural language processing of public sentiment and narrative framing
- Visualization of evolving public perception over time
- Examination of societal shifts in understanding trauma and justice

#### Technologies Used

- Python
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Text Analysis & Sentiment Analysis
- Data Visualization
- Social Media Analytics

#### Research Questions

- How has media framing of the Menendez case evolved from 1989 to 2024?
- What role did Netflix and social media play in reshaping public perception?
- How do contemporary discussions reflect changing attitudes toward male victimization and family violence?
